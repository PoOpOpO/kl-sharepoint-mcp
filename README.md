# Microsoft 365 (SharePoint & OneDrive) MCP Server

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A modern Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that lets ChatGPT (and other MCP compatible clients) interact with SharePoint Online and OneDrive content using Microsoft Graph. The server is designed for environments where multiple Microsoft 365 accounts may exist on the same workstation: each session can authenticate with the signed-in Windows/Microsoft account that the user chooses at runtime.

> **Why this fork?** The original SharePoint-only implementation relied on application credentials tied to a specific tenant. This version embraces user-centric authentication (device code flow + MSAL cache) so the connector works with whichever account is selected on the machine‚Äîideal for teams that share GPT licenses but want to access their own SharePoint/OneDrive resources.

## Feature Highlights

- üîê **Device-code authentication** ‚Äì Pick the Microsoft account that is signed into the local machine instead of the ChatGPT account.
- üë• **Multi-account aware** ‚Äì List cached accounts, switch between them, and inspect the active context at any time.
- üóÇÔ∏è **Drive discovery** ‚Äì Enumerate OneDrive personal drives and SharePoint document libraries.
- üìÑ **Full file lifecycle** ‚Äì Create folders, upload/update files (text or binary), download contents, and delete resources.
- üîç **Deep research** ‚Äì Perform scoped searches inside a drive or global Microsoft Graph Search across SharePoint + OneDrive.
- üìö **Site exploration** ‚Äì Search for SharePoint sites and list their document libraries before activating one.

## MCP Tools Overview

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Start_Device_Login` / `Complete_Device_Login` | Initiate and complete the device-code flow for the desired Microsoft account. |
| `List_Available_Accounts` / `Set_Active_Account` | Inspect cached accounts and pick which one is active. |
| `Get_Auth_Context` / `Get_Graph_Context` | Debug helpers showing the current authentication + drive context. |
| `List_My_Drives` / `List_Site_Drives` / `Search_SharePoint_Sites` | Discover drives and sites available to the active account. |
| `Set_Active_Drive` | Choose the OneDrive or SharePoint library used for subsequent operations. |
| `List_Drive_Items`, `Get_Drive_Item_Metadata`, `Get_Drive_Item_Content` | Explore the selected drive and read file contents. |
| `Create_Drive_Folder`, `Upload_Drive_File`, `Update_Drive_File`, `Delete_Drive_Item` | Create, modify, and remove items. |
| `Search_Drive_Items` | Search inside the currently-selected drive. |
| `Deep_Search_Microsoft365` | Perform a Microsoft Graph Search across SharePoint and OneDrive resources for deep research scenarios. |

All tools automatically reuse the selected Microsoft account and drive context.

## Prerequisites

1. **Azure AD App Registration** ‚Äì Register a *public* client application (no secret) in Azure AD / Entra ID.
   - Redirect URI can be `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient`.
   - Required delegated permissions: `Files.ReadWrite.All`, `Sites.ReadWrite.All`, `User.Read`, and optionally others you need.
2. **Client ID** ‚Äì Note the *Application (client) ID* of the registration.
3. **Python 3.10+** ‚Äì A recent Python interpreter for running the MCP server.

## Configuration

The server is configured with environment variables (you can store them in a `.env` file during development):

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `MCP_GRAPH_CLIENT_ID` | **Required.** Client ID of the Azure AD public application (fallback: `SHP_ID_APP`). |
| `MCP_GRAPH_TENANT_ID` | Optional. Tenant ID to restrict sign-ins. Defaults to `common` for multi-tenant. |
| `MCP_GRAPH_SCOPES` | Optional comma-separated scopes. Defaults to `Files.ReadWrite.All,Sites.ReadWrite.All,User.Read,offline_access`. |
| `MCP_GRAPH_CACHE_PATH` | Optional custom path for the MSAL token cache. Default: `~/.cache/mcp_sharepoint/token_cache.bin`. |
| `MCP_GRAPH_DEFAULT_DRIVE_ID` | Optional drive ID to auto-select on startup. |
| `MCP_GRAPH_LOG_LEVEL` / `MCP_GRAPH_LOG_FILE` | Optional logging settings. |

## Quickstart

### Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Running the server

```bash
python -m mcp_sharepoint
```

Integrate the binary into your MCP-aware client (ChatGPT desktop, Claude Desktop, MCP Inspector, etc.) by referencing the script `mcp-sharepoint` (created via the console script entry point) or by executing `python -m mcp_sharepoint` directly.

### First-time authentication workflow

1. Call `Start_Device_Login` from your MCP client.
2. Follow the `verification_uri` and `user_code` provided to authenticate with the Microsoft account currently logged into the workstation.
3. Call `Complete_Device_Login` with the returned `flow_id` to finish the sign-in.
4. (Optional) Use `List_Available_Accounts` and `Set_Active_Account` to switch between cached profiles.
5. Discover drives with `List_My_Drives` or `List_Site_Drives`, then select one using `Set_Active_Drive`.
6. You are ready to browse, search, and modify files using the rest of the tools.

## Development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
```

Use the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) to debug traffic:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector -- python -m mcp_sharepoint
```
